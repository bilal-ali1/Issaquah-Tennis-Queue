This web application allows people to see the availbility of nearby tennis courts to solve this issue of having to physically be at certain locations in order to check to see if such courts were even avilable to use. For future plans of this project we hope to propose this to the Issaquah Parks and Recreation committee to hopefully increase the engagement and use of this application in the real world with actual parks in Issaquah so that it can serve its purpose of being a remote queue.

We used react to build out the front end of the application and node for the backend, along with Express as a framework to help implement backend functionality.
